        <article id="content">
            <p class="dropcap">The federal government owes Americans a thorough investigation and a truthful accounting
                of the Saturday morning shooting of Alex Jeffrey Pretti on a Minneapolis street. When the government
                kills, it has an obligation to demonstrate that it has acted in the public interest. Instead, the Trump
                administration is once again engaged in a perversion of justice.</p>
            <p>Mere hours after Mr. Pretti died, Kristi Noem, the secretary of homeland security, declared without
                offering evidence that Mr. Pretti had “committed an act of domestic terrorism.” Gregory Bovino, a Border
                Patrol official, offered his own assessment: “This looks like a situation where an individual wanted to
                do maximum damage and massacre law enforcement.”</p>
            <p>These unfounded and inflammatory judgments pre-empt the outcome of an investigation, which the Department
                of Homeland Security has promised. They also appear wholly inconsistent with several videos recorded at
                the scene.</p>
            <p>Those videos showed that Mr. Pretti had nothing but a phone in his hands when he was tackled by Border
                Patrol agents, and that he never drew the gun he was carrying (and reportedly had a license to carry).
                Indeed, the videos seem to show that one federal agent took the gun from Mr. Pretti moments before a
                different agent shot him from behind. Separate analyses by The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal,
                The Associated Press, CBS News and other organizations all concluded that the videos contradict the
                Trump administration’s description of the killing.</p>
            <p>The administration is urging Americans to reject the evidence of their eyes and ears. Ms. Noem and Mr.
                Bovino are lying in defiance of obvious truths. They are lying in the manner of authoritarian regimes
                that require people to accept lies as a demonstration of power.</p>
            <p>Even worse is that all of this feels so terribly familiar. Earlier this month, a federal agent shot and
                killed another Minneapolis resident, Renee Good. In that case, too, the Trump administration has
                demonized the victim and has blocked a state investigation of the killing.</p>
            <p>Truth is a line of demarcation between a democratic government and an authoritarian regime. Mr. Pretti
                and Ms. Good are dead. The American people deserve to know what happened.</p>
            <p>The temperature in Minneapolis is dangerously high. There is an urgent need for the federal agents
                deployed to the city to step back and take a breath before more Americans are hurt or killed. Those
                protesting the Trump administration have an equal obligation to avoid violence.</p>
            <p>The American people also need answers about whether federal agents acted inappropriately, and the
                behavior of the Trump administration means that it will be impossible to trust any federal investigation
                that it conducts. President Trump and his appointees have demonstrated themselves to be unconcerned with
                truth and willing to lie to serve their own interests. Congress therefore must step in. The Constitution
                vests it with the power to hold hearings, issue subpoenas and demand answers.</p>
            <p>Congress ought to investigate both the circumstances of the recent killings in Minneapolis and the
                broader conduct of the federal agencies engaged in Mr. Trump’s immigration crackdown, including their
                treatment of peaceful protesters. The video evidence shows that the incident that ended in Mr. Pretti’s
                death began when a federal agent lunged at a protester and knocked her to the ground. There are many
                similar videos and documented instances of federal agents using unnecessary violence against people who
                are peacefully protesting or documenting events — both behaviors protected under the First Amendment.
            </p>
            <p>Congress has the power to hold the administration accountable through its control of federal spending. A
                pending bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security offers a crucial opportunity to perform
                scrutiny and impose necessary guardrails, such as funding for body cameras.</p>
            <p>The federal government also has sought to prevent investigations by the state of Minnesota. This must
                end. A federal judge in Minnesota issued a temporary restraining order on Saturday evening, at the
                behest of the state, barring federal agencies from destroying evidence related to Mr. Pretti’s killing.
                The need for such an order is both evident and extraordinary.</p>
            <p>“The credibility of ICE and D.H.S. are at stake,” Senator Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican
                increasingly at odds with Mr. Trump, posted on social media on Saturday. “There must be a full joint
                federal and state investigation. We can trust the American people with the truth.”</p>
            <p>The Trump administration has made no attempt to calm the waters in Minneapolis. It is a disgrace that the
                first public comment by Mr. Trump in the wake of Mr. Pretti’s death was to post a picture on social
                media of what he described as “the gunman’s gun.” Stephen Miller, arguably Mr. Trump’s most influential
                adviser, wrote on social media, without offering evidence, that Mr. Pretti was “an assassin.”</p>
            <p>It is premature to reach conclusions about what exactly happened on that Minneapolis street. The Trump
                administration should not have done so, and we will not do so. What is clear, however, is that the
                federal government needs to re-establish public faith in the agencies and officers who are carrying out
                Mr. Trump’s crackdown on immigration. If the administration is allowed to act with impunity and avoid
                even the most basic accountability, the result will be more violence.</p>
